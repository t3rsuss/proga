<h2 align=center>Hobbies</h2>

<p> I have been interested in music since I was 12 years old. As a child, I had a pocket cassette player and an American rap cassette. The sound quality of this player was very poor, so I became interested in radio technology. 
I wanted to improve the sound quality of music, so I made a homemade speaker and an amplifier for it. But it wasn't enough for me to just listen to music - I wanted to create it. I felt that music can convey feelings and emotions more expressively than words.
And I decided to become a programmer for such reasons. First, I have a technical mind. Secondly, I believe that this is a popular and well-paid profession. At first glance, the connection between music and programming is imperceptible. 
But we live in the 21st century and all music is now presented in digital format. And since a modern DJ, in my opinion, is a computer DJ (CJ - Computer Jokey, a person who plays music from a computer or a person who writes music on a PC), then the skills of professional use and setting up a PC + understanding that , how digital sound "looks" greatly contribute to effective DJing. Also, in my opinion, music is quite strongly intertwined with the "Queen of Sciences" by mathematics, because in music there are a lot of such, let's say, mathematical laws and numbers (speed of the track, beats, beats) and in order to bring the tracks together in a DJ set with high quality counts the hits of the so-called "barrel".</p>
